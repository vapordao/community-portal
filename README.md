</p>

A Theme-UI Gatsby starter for projects that will use Dai-UI theme kits.

_See the official [Dai-UI](https://github.com/makerdao/dai-ui) repo for more in-depth information._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone**
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/MaximumCrash/maker-portal-sandbox.git
    ```

2.  **Install**
    _dai-ui-theme-maker and dai-ui-icons are pre-installed._
    ```shell
    # This project makes use of yarn.
    yarn 
    ```

3. **Start**
   ```shell
    yarn start
   ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at some important files and directories you'll see in this project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    |    ├── gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
    |    ├── images
    |    ├── modules
    |    └── pages
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

### Important Directories

1. **`src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`**: This directory contains all files that will be consumed by the gatsby-plugin-theme-ui on build and provided to components through context. For more info see their [docs](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin#customizing-the-theme).

2.  **`src/modules`**: This directory is the mirror image of a components folder. Except it's organized by contextual focused. You can find all your ui related components in the ui folder. 

### Gatsby Usual Suspects

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
